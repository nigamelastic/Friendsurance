 A simple Selenium TestNG test to test the "Expense Management System"

 Due to the limited time frame i have added the bare minium testcases of a positive flow

 The username and password shall be updated everytime u run the entire suite

 I have used the priority and invocation attributes of testng to setup the suit so that it should run in one click.

 I am excluding checks for Amount since there is already a bug for it.

 Please use appropriate Selenium(selenium-server-standalone-3.5.2) and TestNG jars(testng-6.11.jar) and chrome driver executable in order to run the tests.

 PS: intellij IDE community edition was used to create the code
